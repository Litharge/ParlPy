# ParlPy

Package to scrape and process UK Parliamentary bills, votes and MP contact information.

Written as part of University of Bath Integrated Project module.

# Usage

## Install

    pipenv install ParlPy~=2.5.0

## Intended Usage

A list of bills to collect information about is generated using either the `update_all_bills_in_session` or the 
`get_changed_bills_in_session` methods of a BillsOverview object from parlpy.bills.bill_list_fetcher. The former 
simply gets a list of all bills and places them in member DataFrame `bills_overview_data`. The latter has persistence, 
so that its first run behaves like `update_all_bills_in_session`, but after this places only bills updated after it 
was last run in the DataFrame.

The BillsOverview object is then passed to iterator parlpy.bills.bill_details_iterator.get_bill_details(), which yields
an object containing information on the bill, including divisions data

## Intended Example Usage
    
    import parlpy.bills.bill_list_fetcher as blf
    import parlpy.bills.bill_details_iterator as bdi

    test_fetcher = blf.BillsOverview()
    test_fetcher.get_changed_bills_in_session()

    for s in bdi.get_bill_details(test_fetcher):
        summary, bill_divisions_list = s[0], s[1]
        print(f"summary {summary}")
        for d in bill_divisions_list:
            print(f"division name {d.division_name}")
            print(f"division stage {d.division_stage}")
            print(f"ayes {d.ayes}")
            print(f"noes {d.noes}")
    
    # ...
    # repeat, call get_changed_bills_in_session() again (on the same object or new, the pickle works either way), then
    # pass the object to the iterator to get new results

The above gets summary and a list of DivisionDetail objects for each bill. BillsOverview has persistence, storing the
last time `get_changed_bills_in_session` was called using a pickle variable. So eg the script can be run, the values
stored in a DB, then run again later to get info on bills that the parliamentary website says have updated.

# Subpackages

## parlpy.bills.bill_details_iterator 
parlpy.bills.bill_details_iterator for fetching bill data

### get_bill_details(overview: parlpy.bills.bill_list_fetcher.BillsOverview) -> Iterable[BillDetails]

Iterator that yields BillDetails object

### BillDetails

Instance variables
* self.title_stripped: str
* self.title_postfix: str 
* self.sessions: List[str]
* self.summary: str
* self.divisions_list: List[parlpy.bills.bill_votes_fetcher.DivisionInformation]

## parlpy.bills.bill_list_fetcher

### BillsOverview

Not intended for public API use, BillsOverview object is instead passed to 
parlpy.bills.bill_details_iterator.get_bill_details()

Constructs an object for collecting basic information on all bills in the current Parliamentary session. Its purpose is
to
* get a list of existing bills - so that we know what to scrape
* get path to further details for each bill - so that we can assemble the url to scrape further info from
* be passed to parlpy.bills.bill_details_iterator.get_bill_details()

Instance variables:
* self.bills_overview_data -> pd.DataFrame 
  
    DF containing bill titles, their last updated time and the path to further
details on the bill. Determines which bills parlpy.bills.bill_details_iterator.get_bill_details() collects data on
  
Public instance methods:
* get_changed_bills_in_session(session_name="2019-21", fetch_delay=0) -> None
* reset_datetime_last_scraped() -> None
* update_all_bills_in_session(session_name="2019-21", fetch_delay=0) -> None

    Method to called to update self.bills_overview_data, fetching pages at maximum rate when fetch_delay=0

# Data Sources and Rationale

A list of extant bills and acts are scraped from https://bills.parliament.uk. Scraping was the only choice for
collecting this list as outlined in the bullet points below
* There is an official RSS feed, however
this only lists the 50 most recently updated bills, so we do not use this source as we would not have been able to 
collect older bills.
  
* The API at https://explore.data.parliament.uk/?endpoint=bills does not contain bills more recent 
than 2018, so we do not utilise this as it does not present new bills. 
  
* The recent API https://developer.parliament.uk/
does not provide bills.

The package however does make use of the official UK Parliamentary API for collecting division data and for collecting 
data on MP's.

## parlpy.bills.bill_list_fetcher 
`BillsOverview.get_changed_bills_in_session()` and `BillsOverview.update_all_bills_in_session()`

Both scrape data from https://bills.parliament.uk

## parlpy.bills.bill_summary_fetcher
`get_summary()`

Scrapes data from https://bills.parliament.uk

# Versions

## 2.5.2
* updates to account for recent changes to parliamentary website

## 2.5.0
* include optional app engine pickling code

## 2.4.0
* include method in BillsOverview to mock a datetime last scraped pickle
* fix: bills/act titles not conforming to standard layout breaking the bill list fetcher, they are now not added

## 2.3.0
* mp data includes if they are current and their email

## 2.2.0
* mp data includes constituency

## 2.1.0
* iterator return object now includes url and last updated datetime
* add functionality to get constituency from postcode

## 2.0.0
* iterator now returns list of BillDetails objects rather than tuple (API incompat change, hence change of major)
* iterator BillDetails object also now contains sessions for the bill
* improve division categorisation "second reading" vs "third reading" vs "amendments"
* make 2019 onwards session tag have consistent value of 2019-21 (session is actually ongoing at time of writing, but
  Parliament API for divisions uses 2019-21 as the value)
  
## 1.1.0.1
* make scraper session keys match those in utils.dates

## 1.1.0
* add function to get parties and their corresponding ids

## 1.0.1
* improve accuracy of associating divisions with bills

## 1.0.0
* add iterator functionality to get details on bills provided by a BillsOverview object

## 0.1.0
* adds method to get a list only of bills updated since method was last run, uses pickled datetime so that script can
 be stopped and run as required

## 0.0.2
* gets a DataFrame containing bill titles, their last updated times and page paths (page paths to be used in
  future versions)
* page request delay configurable

# Misc Performance Notes
* collecting emails using the Parliament API significantly increases the time to run mp_fetcher methods, so by default 
  only gets emails for current MPs.
    * 33 seconds to run `test_get_active_mps` without email data
    * 272 seconds to run `test_get_active_mps` with email data
